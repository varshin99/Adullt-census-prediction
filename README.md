 ## Motivation
   The Classification models like this help the government to understand the trend in the economy of the country and helps them to concentrate on the weaker economy sections and pull them out from poverty.


 ## Conclusion
  We in this project implemented few classification models like RandomForest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier and KNN and among these hyperparameter tuned random forest classifier was selected as it gave an accuracy score of 90.7 and was used to build the model.
